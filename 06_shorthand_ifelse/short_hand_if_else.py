#There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and
#  the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:


a=50
b=55

print("B is greater") if b>a else print("a is greater") if b>a else print("both are equal")







'''


Another Example
result = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

This syntax is equivalent to the following if-else statement:

if condition:
    result = value_if_true
else:
    result = value_if_false

Conclusion
The shorthand syntax can be a convenient way to write simple if-else statements,
especially when you want to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.
However, it's not suitable for more complex situations where you need to execute'
' multiple statements or perform more complex logic. In those cases, it's best to use the full if-else syntax.
