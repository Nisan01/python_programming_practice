# Variables in Python

# 📝 A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data

# Example 1: storing numbers
age = 25
height = 175

print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)

# Example 2: storing text
color = "blue"
full_name = "Alice Johnson"

print("Name:", full_name)
print("Favorite color:", color)

# Example 3: multiple assignments
x, y, z = 5, 10, 15  # Assign 3 variables in one line
print("x:", x, "y:", y, "z:", z)

# 🧠 Note: Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare variable types
